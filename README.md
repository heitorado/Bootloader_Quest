# Bootloader Quest

Bootloader written in NASM Assembly x86 for academic project.

### Overview
At startup, the qemu emulated BIOS checks the first 512 bytes of the sector, head and trail 0 of the hard disk (this is called the bootsector). If there is a valid boot, then these 512 bytes are loaded in memory, and it runs the code. This bootable code is the boot1, responsible for calling the second code, boot2, making a memory jump for the sector of the code (which is different from the bootsector). After loading and running boot2, the kernel is called.

This kernel consists in a small text-based RPG game with 3 possible endings. Five minutes of gameplay, more or less.

### Installation

Bootloader Quest requires [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and [NASM](http://www.nasm.us/) to run.
